0x00 C - Hello, World ‚úèÔ∏è
C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This is the first step for learning this awesome language

Learning Objectives üìë
At the end of this project, I am able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

Why C programming is awesome (don‚Äôt forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #cisfun :))
Who invented C
Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
What happens when you type gcc main.c
What is an entry point
What is main
How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
How to compile using gcc
What is the default program name when compiling with gcc
What is the official Holberton C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style
How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
How does the main function influence the return value of the program
Tasks ‚úîÔ∏è
Script that runs a C file through the preprocessor
Script that compiles a C file
Script that generates the assembly code of a C code
